This program is written in Java and designed to be used on a Linux system.  The program employs system commands to rip cds using cdparanoia and convert them to the ogg format using oggenc (part of vorbis-tools).  The resulting files are organized by book name with subfolders for the cd number.  The program uses the preferences API to remember the book name and author and to autoincrement the CD number to save time.
